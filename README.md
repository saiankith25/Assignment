# Assignment 1: Practice with Widgets

The objective of this first assignment is to familiarize yourselves with
Android Studio and the different tools that are shipped with the IDE. If
you still haven't downloaded and installed Android Studio, you will have
to do it ASAP. Android Studio can be downloaded here:
https://developer.android.com/studio/

## Technical specifications 

The provided starter code is condifured to run on devices with at least
Android Pie (API 28). As a result, make sure that you have downloaded
the appropriate version of the SDK in the SDK Manager. Additionnally,
you might want to create an Android Virtual Device with this specific
version of the SDK to run and test your app.

The starter code is provided as is, and should work on your laptop. If
you face issues with using the starter code for your homework, please
contact your instructor ASAP.

*Important*: The first thing that you should do is to create an 'Empty
Activity' called MainActivity. Be sure to check the box "Launcher
Activity" when creating it. After that, you should be ready to work on
your assignment.

The specifications are detailed in the following section.

## Description of the App

In this assignment, you will manipulate basic widgets that we have seen
during the first lecture:

- Button
- TextView
- EditText

Your assignment consists in adding an item of each to the MainActivity,
with the following characteristics:

- The EditText will take the whole width of the Activity (minus small
  margins) and can display texts spanning on several lines. 
- The Button, once clicked, should update the text of the TextView so as
  to display what was typed in the EditText.
- The TextView should present design attributes similar to the ones of
  the EditText. In particular, it should also be able to display text on
  several lines.


The look and design of the app is not important and won't be considered
when grading your assignment.

__Bonus__: 
1. Create Buttons to change the font color of the TextView
2. Create Buttons to change the font size of the TextView
